### Use a conversational LLM to hone in on an idea (I use ChatGPT 4o / o3 for this)
Ask me one question at a time so we can develop a thorough, step-by-step spec for this idea. Each question should build on my previous answers, and our end goal is to have a detailed specification I can hand off to a developer. Let’s do this iteratively and dig into every relevant detail. Remember, only one question at a time.

Here’s the idea:

<IDEA>

#### At the end of the brainstorm (it will come to a natural conclusion):
Now that we’ve wrapped up the brainstorming process, can you compile our findings into a comprehensive, developer-ready specification? Include all relevant requirements, architecture choices, data handling details, error handling strategies, and a testing plan so a developer can immediately begin implementation.


#### Save the idea into a spec.md


You can use this spec for a number of things. We are doing codegen here, but I have used it to bolster ideas by asking a reasoning model to poke holes in the idea (must go deeper!), to generate a white paper, or to generate a business model. You can pop it into deep research and get a 10k word supporting document in return.
